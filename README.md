# Simulation-project-on-linked-list
This project simulates the internal working of Singly and Doubly Linked Lists in C++. It shows how nodes are created, linked, searched, and deleted with detailed step-by-step pointer updates. Ideal for learning data structures through clear visualization and interactive menu-driven operations.
Linked List Simulation Project (C++)

This project simulates the **internal working of Singly and Doubly Linked Lists** using C++.  
It prints every internal pointer movement, node creation, deletion, and traversal to help students visualize how a linked list works behind the scenes.

📘 Project Overview
Linked Lists are dynamic data structures that use pointers to connect nodes stored in non-contiguous memory locations.  
This project provides an **interactive simulation** of:

- Singly Linked List  
- Doubly Linked List  
- Menu-driven operations  
- Step-by-step pointer visualization  

 Features

Singly Linked List**
- Insert at head  
- Insert at tail  
- Delete a node  
- Search a node  
- Display list  
- Internal step logs (pointer updates)

Doubly Linked List**
- Insert at tail  
- Forward traversal  
- Backward traversal  
- Simulation of `prev` and `next` pointer updates  

General Features**
- Clean OOP-based C++ implementation  
- Easy-to-understand simulation logs  
- Fully modular code  
- Suitable for B.Tech / Diploma / CS projects
