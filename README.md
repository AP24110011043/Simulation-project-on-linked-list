# Simulation-project-on-linked-list
This project simulates the internal working of Singly and Doubly Linked Lists in C++. It shows how nodes are created, linked, searched, and deleted with detailed step-by-step pointer updates. Ideal for learning data structures through clear visualization and interactive menu-driven operations.
